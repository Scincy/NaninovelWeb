# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Naninovel is an extension for [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/), so it's strongly recommended to at least learn the basics of using the engine before starting with Naninovel.

The following manual chapters should be considered essential:
- [Installing Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub)
- [Creating Projects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStarted)
- [Editor Interface](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LearningtheInterface)
- [Using the Asset Store](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetStore)
- [Publishing Builds](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds)

In case you're not going to build any custom gameplay outside of Naninovel, feel free to ignore the scene-related information altogether, as Naninovel will take care of that.

## Create New Unity Project
Consult the [Unity manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStarted) on how to create a new project.

When creating a project you'd probably like to use `2D Template` to set the editor in 2D behaviour mode, so that images will be imported as sprite assets by default and you won't have to manually change the import settings. You can change the editor behaviour mode later using the [project settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/2DAnd3DModeSettings.html).

When you create a new project, Unity will automatically add a sample scene with two game objects inside it: a "Main Camera" and "Directional Light". Naninovel is completely scene-independent, so you can remove those two objects from the scene so they don't produce any unnecessary performance overhead. You can also remove the sample scene itself, though it's recommended to have at least one scene in a project for some editor features to work correctly.

## Install Naninovel
Import Naninovel package using the [Asset Store window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetStore.html) and wait for the initial scripts compilation and assets import process. You are free to move `Naninovel` package folder anywhere inside your project assets directory, if you wish.

Over the course of using Naninovel a number of assets (configuration, settings, saves, etc) will be automatically generated inside `Assets/NaninovelData` folder. In contrast to the package folder, you shouldn't manually move the data folder (it'll be automatically regenerated). If you wish to change the location of the data folder, edit `Generated Data Path` property in the engine configuration menu.

## Add Naninovel Script
Use `Create -> Naninovel -> Naninovel Script` assets context menu to create a naninovel script asset. 

![Create Naninovel Script](https://i.gyazo.com/be7677077abeb4f805979bd647d6d90e.png)

*Notice: you can create and store naninovel scripts (as well as all the other Naninovel resources) under any project folder and organize them in any way you like; the naming is also up to you. The above illustration is just an example.*

Naninovel scripts are text documents (`.nani` extension) where you control what happens on scenes. You can open and edit them with a text editor of your choice, like Notepad, TextEdit or [Atom](https://atom.io).

![Open Naninovel Script](https://i.gyazo.com/f552c2ef323f9ec1171eba72e0c55432.png)

You can also use visual script editor to edit the naninovel scripts. Select the created script asset and you'll see the visual editor automatically open in the inspector window.

<video class="video" loop autoplay><source src="https://i.gyazo.com/e1f40ff0fb7898e11afa0f058bb6ed6d.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To add a new line to the script, either right-click the place, where you want to insert the line, or press `Ctrl+Space` (you can change the default key bindings in the input configuration menu) and select the desired line or command type. To re-order lines, drag them using their number labels. To remove a line, right-click it and choose "Remove".

When you've changed the script using visual editor, you'll see an asterisk (`*`) over the script name in the inspector header. That means the asset is dirty and need to be saved; press `Ctrl+S` to save the asset. In case you'll attempt to select another asset while the script is dirty, a dialogue window will pop-up allowing to either save or revert the changes.

The visual editor will automatically sync edited script if you update it externally, so you can seamlessly work with the scripts in both text and visual editors.

*In the rest of this guide we will use a text editor, but you can repeat all the same steps with the visual editor, if you wish.*

In order for a Naninovel-related asset (like our created script) to become "visible" for the engine, it should be assigned as a project resource. When creating the scripts via the create assets menu, they're assigned automatically. To assign (or edit/remove) a script resource manually use script resources window accessible with `Naninovel -> Resources -> Scripts` editor context menu. To add a script, press `+` (plus sign) button in the list to add a new record and drag-drop script asset to the list. It's also possible to drag-drop multiple assets or even whole folders to the list to add them in batch.

![Add Naninovel Script](https://i.gyazo.com/b3281a145ba54e6cb6cbdaa478ea894d.png)

Open the created script in a text editor and add the following text:
```
Hello World!
@stop
```
The first line will print the text "Hello World!" when the game is run and the second is required to gracefully stop script execution.

Enter play mode and start a new game to see the result.

In case "NEW GAME" button of the title menu is not active, make sure "Start Game Script" property in the script configuration (`Naninovel -> Configuration -> Scripts`) is equal to the name of the created script. The property is populated automatically when creating the first script via create asset menu, but this may not work if you copy some existing script to the project.

## Add Character
Characters in Naninovel can be based on regular and diced sprites, animated Live2D models and 3D meshes; you can add your own implementations as well. For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll use a sprite implementation. 

Each character is represented by ID and a set of appearances. To add a character, use character manager GUI accessible via `Naninovel -> Resources -> Characters` menu, add a new character actor record specifying its ID, then double click the record (or press button at the and of the record) and add all the appearance sprites to the `Resources` list. Just like with naninovel scripts, you can drag-drop multiple assets and folders to the list.

![Add Character](https://i.gyazo.com/c8a4f7f987621831b4a2ecb3145a4a07.png)

Let’s assume the added character ID is "Kohaku". Edit naninovel script to show the added character:
```
@char Kohaku
Hello World!
@stop
```
Run the game and you’ll see one of the character appearance sprites at the center of the screen. When you don’t specify an appearance, either the one named equal to character's ID or "Default" will be chosen by default. To select a specific appearance, add its name after the character ID separated by a dot like this:
```
@char Kohaku.Happy
Hello World!
@stop
```
Given there is an appearance with the name "Happy" added for the character "Kohaku", the corresponding sprite will now be shown instead of the default one.

You can now associate the printed text with the character by adding its ID followed by a colon before the text:
```
@char Kohaku.Happy
Kohaku: Hello World!
@stop
```
It's also possible to join character's appearance with the printed text to save some typing:
```
Kohaku.Happy: Hello World!
@stop
```

To hide (remove from scene) a character (or any other actor, like background, text printer, etc), use [`@hide`](/api/#hide) command followed by actor ID:
```
Kohaku.Happy: Hello World!
@hide Kohaku
@stop
```

## Add Background
Similar to characters, a background can be represented in multiple ways in Naninovel: sprite, generic object, video and scene; custom user implementations are also possible. 

While you can create multiple independent background actors, in a typical VN game you'll usually use just one and transition it to different appearances. To simplify the routine, a `MainBackground` actor is added to the background actors list by default and you don't have to specify the ID every time to change its appearance in naninovel scripts.

Add background sprites via `Naninovel -> Resources -> Backgrounds` menu. `MainBackground` record will open automatically, but you can still return to the actors list and create others, if you wish.

![Add Background](https://i.gyazo.com/98e88780625c7f2e1ef88db7ef10d1f4.png)

Let’s assume the added background appearance sprite is named "City". To show a background, use a [`@back`](/api/#back) command followed by the background appearance name:
```
@back City 
```
When switching between backgrounds a cross-fade [transition effect](/guide/transition-effects.md) will be used by default. To change the effect, specify transition type after the appearance name:
```
@back City 
@back School.RadialBlur
```
This will transition "City" to "School" using "RadialBlur" transition effect.

## Add Music and Sound Effects
To add a BGM (background music) or SFX (sound effect) asset, use `Naninovel -> Resources -> Audio` editor menu. You can use any audio formats [supported by Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioFiles.html).

![Managing Audio](https://i.gyazo.com/cacdec36623dbbfcf9f49c594de53c0f.png)

Let’s assume the added BGM file name is "ThePromenade". To play this track as a background music use [`@bgm`](/api/#bgm) command followed by the name of the track:
```
@bgm ThePromenade
```
A cross-fade effect will be automatically applied when switching the music tracks. The music will loop by default, though you can change this, as well as volume and fade duration using command parameters.

On the contrary, sound effects won't loop by default. Assuming you've added an "Explosion" SFX, use an [`@sfx`](/api/#sfx) command to play it back:
```
@sfx Explosion
```
