# Playmaker

[PlayMaker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/playmaker-368) is a popular visual scripting tool for Unity specifically designed to be friendly for non-programmers.

Be aware, that in contrast to Bolt, where all the Naninovel's C# API is available by default, PlayMaker requires creating a special C# class for each action. This means that only a limited subset of the engine API is available out of the box when using PlayMaker. The available custom actions could also break in case Naninovel's API change (especially while we're in beta development stage).

## Setup

Install PlayMaker following instructions from the [official manual](https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W11).

Download and import [PlayMaker extension package](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelPlayMaker/raw/master/NaninovelPlayMaker.unitypackage).

The custom Naninovel actions should appear in the PlayMaker actions browser under "Naninovel" category.

## Usage

The following video demonstrates using PlayMaker FSM (finite state machine) to initialize Naninovel engine, preload and play a scenario script.

### Events

Some of the essential Naninovel events can be automatically routed to PlayMaker FSMs. For this, create a global [user event](https://hutonggames.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W148) with an appropriate name and use it inside an FSM. Following are the available event names:

- `Naninovel/Engine/OnInitialized`
- `Naninovel/ScriptPlayer/OnPlay`
- `Naninovel/ScriptPlayer/OnStop`
- `Naninovel/StateManager/OnGameSaveStarted`
- `Naninovel/StateManager/OnGameSaveFinished`
- `Naninovel/StateManager/OnGameLoadStarted`
- `Naninovel/StateManager/OnGameLoadFinished`
- `Naninovel/TextPrinterManager/OnPrintTextStarted`
- `Naninovel/TextPrinterManager/OnPrintTextFinished`
- `Naninovel/LocalizationManager/OnLocaleChanged`

It's also possible to broadcast custom PlayMaker events from naninovel scripts using `@playmaker` command:

```
@playmaker EventName
```

— will invoke a global user event named "EventName" in all the active FSMs on scene.

The command also allows sending events to specific FSMs by using `fsm` and `object` parameters. The first parameter allows specifying FSM names, which should receive the event, eg: 

```
@playmaker EventName fsm:Fsm1,Fsm2
```

— will invoke an event named "EventName" for FSMs with name "Fsm1" and "Fsm2".  

When `object` parameter is specified, the event will only be sent to FSMs, that are applied to game objects, which has corresponding names, eg:

```
@playmaker EventName object:Obj1,Obj2
```

— will invoke an event named "EventName" for all the FSMs, that are attached to game objects with names "Obj1" and "Obj2".  

You can as well combine `fsm` and `object` parameters to farther filter the FSMs, that should receive the event.

### Global Variables

It's possible to access a global PlayMaker variable in Naninovel scripts with the following custom [expression functions](/guide/script-expressions.html#expression-functions) available in the extension package:
 - `GetPlayMakerGlobalVariable("variableName")` — retrieves a variable of a simple type (int, float, string, etc) with the "variableName" name
 - `GetPlayMakerGlobalArray("variableName", arrayIndex)` — retrieves a value stored at "arrayIndex" index of an array variable with the "variableName" name

Given you have a "Score" integer and "FinishedRoutes" bool array global PlayMaker variables, you can use them in Naninovel scripts as follow:
```
Felix: My score is {GetPlayMakerGlobalVariable("Score")}.

@if GetPlayMakerGlobalArray("FinishedRoutes",2)
    Third route (second array index) is completed.
@else
    Not yet.
@endif
```

## IDE Extension

To add support for `@playmaker` command to [Atom IDE extension](/guide/naninovel-scripts.md#ide-support), open metadata file located at `%HOMEPATH%/.atom/packages/language-naniscript/server/metadata.json` (`%HOMEPATH%` is the path to your OS user directory) and add following record to `commands` array: 

```json
{
  "id": "BroadcastPlayMakerEvent",
  "alias": "playmaker",
  "localizable": false,
  "summary": "Broadcasts a PlayMaker event with the provided name.",
  "params": [
    {
      "id": "EventName",
      "nameless": true,
      "required": true,
      "dataType": {
        "kind": "literal",
        "contentType": "string"
      },
      "summary": "Name of the event to broadcast."
    },
    {
      "id": "FsmNames",
      "alias": "fsm",
      "nameless": false,
      "required": false,
      "dataType": {
        "kind": "array",
        "contentType": "string"
      },
      "summary": "Names of FSMs for which to broadcast the event."
    },
    {
      "id": "GameObjectNames",
      "alias": "object",
      "nameless": false,
      "required": false,
      "dataType": {
        "kind": "array",
        "contentType": "string"
      },
      "summary": "Names of game objects for which to broadcast the event."
    }
  ]
},
```

After the edit, the file should start as follows:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "id": "BroadcastPlayMakerEvent",
      "alias": "playmaker",
```

Restart the Atom editor (in case it was running), and the `@playmaker` command should no longer be highlighted as an error.
