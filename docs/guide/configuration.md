# Configuration
The engine configuration is stored in multiple scriptable object assets located at `Assets/NaninovelData/Resources/Naninovel/Configuration` folder. They are automatically generated when opening the corresponding configuration menus in the Unity editor for the first time. 

Use `Naninovel -> Configuration` or `Edit -> Project Settings -> Naninovel` to access the configuration menu.

Notice, that all the configuration menus are supporting [Unity's presets feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets). It could be useful to create several configuration presets when deploying to different target platforms (eg, mobile, standlone, consoles, etc).

This configuration reference is valid for [Naninovel v1.9.4-beta](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelWeb/releases).
