# Resource Providers

Resource providers are used to retrieve Naninovel-related data: ".nani" text files for scenario scripts, textures for character sprites, audio clips for music, etc. Each provider specializes in retrieving the data from a specific source: project's "Resources" folders, Unity's addressable asset system, local file storage, a Google Drive account, etc.

Providers' general behavior can be configured via `Naninovel -> Configuration -> Resource Provider` menu.

`Resource Policy` property dictates when the resources are loaded and unloaded during script execution:
 - Static — All the resources required for the script execution are pre-loaded when starting the playback (masked with a loading screen) and unloaded only when the script has finished playing. This policy is default and recommended for most cases.
 - Dynamic — Only the resources required for the next `Dynamic Policy Steps` commands are pre-loaded when starting the playback and all the unused resources are unloaded immediately. Use this mode when targetting platforms with strict memory limitations and it's impossible to properly organize naninovel scripts. Expect hiccups when the resources are loaded in background while the game is progressing.

When `Log Resources Loading` is enabled, various provider-related log messages will be mirrored to the default loading screen UI.

`Enable Build Processing` enables a build pre-processing procedure required to inject assets assigned via editor menus to the builds. Only disable this if you're using a [custom build environment](/guide/custom-build-environment.md) or attaching your own build hooks. When [addressable system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest) is installed, enabling `Use Addressables` will optimize asset processing step improving the build time; enabling `Auto Build Bundles` at the same time will cause asset bundles to automatically compile when building the player.

Other properties in the configuration menu are provider-specific and described below.

Resource-specific providers behavior is configured via `Loader` properties, available in the corresponding configuration menus. For example, here is the default loader configuration used to retrieve audio resources (BGM and SFX):

`Path Prefix` property allows specifying an additional path over provider's root path for the specific type of resources. Eg, given we're going to retrieve an "Explosion" audio file from a project's "Resources" folder, setting path prefix to "Naninovel/Audio" will result in the following resource request: `Resources.Load("Naninovel/Audio/Explosion")`.

`Providers List` allows specifying which provider types to use and in which order. Eg, in the above example, when requesting an audio resource, first an "Addressable" provider will be used and in case the provider won't be able to find the requested resource, "Project" provider will be used.

Be aware, that **while in editor a special "Editor" resource provider is always used first** (no matter the loaders configuration). The provider has access to all the resources assigned via Naninovel's configuration and resource manager menus (`Naninovel -> Resources -> ...`). When the game is built, all such resources are automatically copied to a temporary "Resources" folder or (when [addressable system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest) is installed and enabled) registered in the addressables configuration and compiled to asset bundles. Remember to **always perform any provider-related tests in builds**, not in the Unity editor.

## Addressable

The [Addressable Asset system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest) is a Unity package providing an easy way to load assets by "address". It uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location (local storage, remote web hosting, etc) with any collection of dependencies. Consult Unity's documentation on how to setup, configure and use the system.

Naninovel will automatically use addressables when the package is installed in the project. No additional setup is required. All the assets assigned in the Naninovel's configuration menus (eg, scenario scripts, character sprites, audio clips, etc) will be registered with the system (assigned an "address" under "Naninovel" group) when building the player.

In order for an addressable asset to become "visible" for Naninovel, its address should start with "Naninovel/" and it should has a "Naninovel" label assigned. You can specify additional labels to filter the assets used by Naninovel via `Extra Labels` property in resource provider configuration menu. Be aware, that "Naninovel" addressable group is automatically re-generated on each build; either use another group to specify custom resources or disable `Enable Build Processing` property in resource provider configuration menu and manually process the assets upon build.

In case you wish to configure how the Naninovel addressable assets should be served (eg, specify a remove web host), edit "Naninovel" group via `Window -> Asset Management -> Addressables -> Groups` menu. The group is automatically created when first building the game; in case it's missing, you can create it manually.

*Notice: We're not providing any tutorials or support for Unity's addressable asset system itself, be it setting up a remote web hosting for you assets or some other deploy/serving scenario. Consult the official docs or contact Unity support for more information on the topic.*

## Project

Project provider serves the assets located in "Resources" folders of your Unity project. Consult Unity's guide for more information regarding the project [resources loading API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LoadingResourcesatRuntime).

Be aware, that in most cases [using "Resources" folders is discouraged](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BestPracticeUnderstandingPerformanceInUnity6). Consider assigning the resource via a Naninovel resource manager menu when possible or use an addressable system instead; don't forget to move the asset out of a "Resources" folder after that.

## Local

Local provider allows serving simple (scenario scripts and managed text, sprite characters and backgrounds, audio) assets from an arbitrary location in the local file system.

`Local Path Root` property in the resource provider configuration should point to a folder, where the local resources are stored. You can either use an absolute (eg, `C:\Resources`) or a relative path, starting with one of the following origins:

 - `%DATA%` — Game data folder on the target device ([Application.dataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-dataPath));
 - `%PDATA%` — Persistent data directory on the target device ([Application.persistentDataPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath));
 - `%STREAM%` — "StreamingAssets" folder ([Application.streamingAssetsPath](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-streamingAssetsPath));
 - `%SPECIAL{F}%` — An OS special folder, where `F` is the name of a [special folders enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.specialfolder) value.

Default `%DATA%/Resources` value points to a "Resources" folder inside game's data directory (which is different depending on the target platform).

As one of the usage examples, let's say you want to load naninovel scripts from a `C:/Users/Admin/Dropbox/MyGame/Scripts` folder, which you share with collaborators to author the scenario. While it's possible to just specify an absolute path to the root folder (`C:/Users/Admin/Dropbox/MyGame`), that will require all your collaborators to also store the folder by the exact same path (under the same drive label and user name). Instead, use the following relative path over a "UserProfile" special folder origin: `%SPECIAL{UserProfile}%/Dropbox/MyGame`. 

![](https://i.gyazo.com/eb435b782cfb9df6c403702e8f6124df.png)

Given path prefix under the scripts configuration is set to `Scripts` and local provider is added to the list, script navigator (accessible with `nav` [console command](/guide/development-console.md)) should now pick up any ".nani" text files stored under the folder.

## Google Drive

Implemented via an open source (MIT license) third-party package [UnityGoogleDrive](https://github.com/Elringus/UnityGoogleDrive) allows using [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive) as the provider for the following resources: 

* Naninovel scripts and managed text (via Google Documents);
* Characters and backgrounds (sprite implementation only);
* BGM, SFX and voice.

You can share your Google Drive resources folder with other users to work in collaboration without the need to use version control systems or other complicated tools.

In order to be able to choose Google Drive as the resource provider you have to first install [UnityGoogleDrive](https://github.com/Elringus/UnityGoogleDrive). Consult the GitHub project readme for installation and setup instructions. 

When UnityGoogleDrive package is installed and configured, related properties will appear in the resource provider configuration menu.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/57281ae3a47e85690d9141179af768a8.png)

`Google Drive Root Path` is a relative path inside your google drive's folder to a directory, which should be considered the resources root. Eg, if you want to store the scenario scripts under `MyGame/Scripts`, specify the root as `MyGame`.

With `Google Drive Request Limit` property you can set maximum allowed concurrent requests when contacting Google Drive API. This is required to prevent communication errors when using a personal google drive plan, which is limiting the number of allowed concurrent requests.

`Google Drive Cache Policy` dictates caching behavior of the downloaded resources. `Smart` will attempt to use [Changes API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/changes) to check whether the requested (cached) resource has changed on the remote folder before downloading it. `Purge All On Init` will purge the cache on engine initialization and always use cached versions after the first download. The cache can also be manually purged at any time with `purge` [console command](/guide/development-console.md).

Don't forget to add google drive to the list of providers for the resources you wish to retrieve with it. Eg, following will make the script manager to look for scripts in the Google Drive in addition to addressable and project sources:

See [NaninovelSandbox](https://github.com/Elringus/NaninovelSandbox) project for an example on how to setup and use Google Drive provider.

## Custom Providers

It's possible to add a custom implementation of a resource provider and make Naninovel use it with (or instead of) built-in providers.

To add a custom provider, create a C# class with a parameterless constructor and implement `IResourceProvider` interface. Once created, custom provider type will appear in all the loader configuration menus along with the built-in types.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/c944c5776be76b80d94b36bfe7ee9a08.png)

You can find built-in resource provider implementations at `Naninovel/Runtime/Common/ResourceProvider` package directory; feel free to use them as a reference when implementing your own versions.

Below is an example of a custom provider, that does nothing, but logs messages when used.

```csharp
using Naninovel;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UniRx.Async;

public class CustomResourceProvider : IResourceProvider
{
    public event Action<float> OnLoadProgress;
    public event Action<string> OnMessage;

    public bool IsLoading => default;
    public float LoadProgress => default;
    public IEnumerable<Resource> LoadedResources => default;

    public Resource<T> GetLoadedResourceOrNull<T> (string path) 
        where T : UnityEngine.Object
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"GetLoadedResourceOrNull: {path}");
        return default;
    }

    public UniTask<Resource<T>> LoadResourceAsync<T> (string path) 
        where T : UnityEngine.Object
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"LoadResourceAsync: {path}");
        OnLoadProgress?.Invoke(1f);
        return default;
    }

    public UniTask<IEnumerable<Resource<T>>> LoadResourcesAsync<T> (string path) 
        where T : UnityEngine.Object
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"LoadResourcesAsync: {path}");
        OnLoadProgress?.Invoke(1f);
        return default;
    }

    public UniTask<IEnumerable<Folder>> LocateFoldersAsync (string path)
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"LocateFoldersAsync: {path}");
        return default;
    }

    public UniTask<IEnumerable<string>> LocateResourcesAsync<T> (string path) 
        where T : UnityEngine.Object
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"LocateResourcesAsync: {path}");
        return default;
    }

    public UniTask<bool> ResourceExistsAsync<T> (string path) 
        where T : UnityEngine.Object
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"ResourceExistsAsync: {path}");
        return default;
    }

    public bool ResourceLoaded (string path)
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"ResourceLoaded: {path}");
        return default;
    }

    public bool ResourceLoading (string path)
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"ResourceLoading: {path}");
        return default;
    }

    public bool SupportsType<T> () 
        where T : UnityEngine.Object
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"SupportsType: {typeof(T).Name}");
        return default;
    }

    public void UnloadResource (string path)
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke($"UnloadResource: {path}");
    }

    public void UnloadResources ()
    {
        OnMessage?.Invoke("UnloadResources");
    }
}
```
