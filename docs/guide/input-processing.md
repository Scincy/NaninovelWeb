# Input Processing
 
Engine processes user input using pre-configured listeners. Each input listener has the following properties:

Property | Description
--- | ---
Name | Identifier of the input listener. Used to reference the listener by other engine systems.
Always Process | Whether to process the input while in input blocking mode. E.g. when playing a movie.
Keys | List of keys (buttons) which activate the input.
Axes | List of axes (eg, a mouse or a gamepad analog stick) which activate the input.
Swipes | List of swipes (touch screen) which activate the input.

For specific values see Unity's input guide: [docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConventionalGameInput](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConventionalGameInput.html).

You can configure the built-in input bindings and add new listeners using `Naninovel -> Configuration -> Input` context menu; for available options see [configuration guide](/guide/configuration.md#input).

## Gamepad and Keyboard

All the built-in features are usable with gamepad or keyboard input. You can remove, change or add gamepad/keyboard-specific hotkey bindings via the aforementioned bindings editor menu.

The built-in UIs can also be navigated with a gamepad or keyboard, without using mouse or touch input. When in any of modal menus (outside of main gameplay mode, eg title menu, backlog, etc), press a navigation key (directional pad or left stick on gamepad, arrow keys on keyboard) to select a button in the menu. The first focused button (game object) can be changed in each UI using `Focus Object` field.

With `Focus Mode` property you can change whether the assigned game object should be focused immediately after the UI becomes visible or after a navigation key is pressed. Be aware, that gamepad navigation over UIs will only work when Unity's new input system is installed in the project; find more information about the input system below.

When in the main gameplay mode (outside of modal UIs), press a button binded to `Pause` input (`Esc` and `Backspace` keys for keyboard and `Start` button for gamepad by default) to open pause menu, where you can save/load game, open settings, exit to title, etc.

## Input System

Naninovel supports Unity's new [Input System](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/10/14/introducing-the-new-input-system/); see the [official docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/Installation.html) on how to install and enable the input system. When the input system package is installed (don't forget to enable new input backend in the player settings), an `Input Actions` property will appear in the input configuration menu.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/7c6d767c0f3443e1999fe14917080eb1.png)

Assign [input actions asset](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual/ActionAssets.html?q=input%20actions%20asset) to the property, then create "Naninovel" action map and add input actions with names equal to the Naninovel's binding names. The list of the built-in binding names can be found in the "Bindings" list under "Control Scheme" in the same configuration window. Below is an example input actions configuration.

When properly configured, input actions will activate Naninovel's bindings. In case you wish to disable legacy input processing (which is set under the "Bindings" list), disable `Process Legacy Bindings` property under input configuration menu.

Be aware, that touch and object-related input is still processed via legacy input, so don't completely disable legacy backend in the player settings, unless you're going to implement the features yourself.

For more information on using new input system (eg, how to configure particular bindings or allow players to override the bindings at runtime), consult the [official manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.0/manual).
