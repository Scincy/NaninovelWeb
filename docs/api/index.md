## arrange

#### Summary
Arranges specified characters by X-axis.  When no parameters provided, will execute an auto-arrange evenly distributing visible characters by X-axis.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="action-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the action identifer without specifying parameter name">CharacterPositions</span> | LiteralMap&lt;Single&gt; | Character name to scene local X-axis position map.  Local scene position 0 relates to the left border and 1 to the right border of the screen; 0.5 is the center.
wait | Boolean | Whether the `Naninovel.NovelScriptPlayer` should wait for the async action execution before playing next action.
time | Single | Determines for how long (in seconds) action should execute. Derived actions could (or could not) use this parameter.
if | String | A `Naninovel.Actions.ConditionalFlow` expression, controlling whether this action should execute.  See `@if` action for the expression syntax reference.

</div>

#### Example
```
; Evenly distribute all the visible characters
@arrange

; Place character with name `Jenna` 15%, `Felix` 50% and `Mia` 85% away
; from the left border of the screen.
@arrange Jenna.0.15,Felix.0.5,Mia.0.85
```

## back

#### Summary
Modifies a `Naninovel.IBackgroundActor`.

#### Remarks
Backgrounds are handled a bit differently from characters. Most of the time we'll only have  one background actor on scene, which will constantly transition to different appearances.  To free the user from always repeating one actor name in scripts, we allow to just  provide background name (appearance) and transition type as a nameless param and assume that  `main` actor should be affected. When this is not the case, the name of the actor can be explicitly  provided via the `Naninovel.Actions.ModifyActor`3.Name` parameter.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="action-param-nameless" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the action identifer without specifying parameter name">AppearanceAndTransition</span> | Pair&lt;String, String&gt; | Appearance to set for the modified background and name of the transition effect to use.  When transition is not provided, a cross-fade effect will be used by default.  See [/guide/background-transition-effects.html](https://naninovel.com/guide/background-transition-effects.html) for the list of available transition effects.
params | Single[] | Parameters of the transition effect.
pos | Single[] | Position (in scene local space) to set for the modified actor.  Scene space described as follows: x0y0 is at the bottom left and x1y1 is at the top right corner of the screen.

isVisible | Boolean | Visibility status to set for the modified actor.
position | Single[] | Position (in world space) to set for the modified actor.
rotation | Single[] | Rotation to set for the modified actor.
scale | Single[] | Scale to set for the modified actor.
wait | Boolean | Whether the `Naninovel.NovelScriptPlayer` should wait for the async action execution before playing next action.
time | Single | Determines for how long (in seconds) action should execute. Derived actions could (or could not) use this parameter.
if | String | A `Naninovel.Actions.ConditionalFlow` expression, controlling whether this action should execute.  See `@if` action for the expression syntax reference.

</div>

#### Example
```
; Set `River` as the appearance of the main background

; script sequence will simulate two explosions appearing far and close to the camera.
@sfx ExplosionSound volume:0.1
@back name:ExplosionSprite scale:0.3 pos:0.55,0.6 time:0 isVisible:false
